# Neural Network Recommenders

Neural network recommenders with data pre-processing on real buisness hotel data.

Most of the code belongs to **[Piotr Zio≈Ço](https://github.com/PiotrZiolo)**, who teaches "Recommendation Systems" in the summer semester 2021/2022. My contribution was to complete the tasks in the indicated places.

3. Open CMD and go to project folder where you can find env.yaml file - it contains information required to correctly create environment
4. Prepare your conda environment (instructions given for Windows 64bit)
```
conda env create --file env.yaml -n rs-cb-env python=3.8.0
```
5. Activate your newly created environment
```
conda activate rs-nn-env
```
6. Open main folder with Visual Studio Code
7. Install two extensions in Visual Studio Code: "Jupyter" and "Python"
8. Open desired .ipynb file and in the top-right side click "Select kernel" and choose your environment "rs-cb-env"
